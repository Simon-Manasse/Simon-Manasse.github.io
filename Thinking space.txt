          <p>Currently I am studying ICT at HZ university of aplied sciences. I have been facinated by computers ever
            since i was a kid. At age 6 I was taking apart computers, then putting them back together. I started
            learning programing on my own at age 12, with pascal, on a Pentium 1 PC.</p>
            <p>Even though, my biggest intrest is ICT, I have several other things I long for. Here are some of them:</p>

              <li>I've been dancing for 8 years. I started Hungarian folk dancing, because I wanted to bond with my own
                culture.
              </li> 
              <li>I have been playing the piano for 12 years.</li>
              <li>Psychology, such as body language, and trauma processing.</li>
              <li>Philosophy (Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer).</li>
              <li>Getting as much knowledge as possible.</li>
