I started programming at the age of 12 
and I spent 4 years in school studying ICT, 
but I have a lot to improve

My programming journey started when I started learning Pascal
at the age of 12 on my own, on my Pentium I Pc.
Then I learned Python, and C#. I have some experience but
I still have a lot to learn and I hope I will achieve that goal during
university.
