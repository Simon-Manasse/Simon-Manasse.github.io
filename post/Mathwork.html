                    <p>MathWorks develops mathematical computing software, MATLAB and Simulink. They focus on
                        mathematical
                        usage of programming, but other than that they also research machine learning, deep learning,
                        and
                        many more (AI, data science, optimization). In these fields they are looking for software
                        engineers,
                        compiler engineers, etc. </p>

                    <p>Their employees stated that the work is not that strict, and everyone is friendly, smart, and
                        100%
                        collaborative.In essence this company is all about math and developing software for people who
                        use
                        math with their work. Because I love both math and ICT, this is one of my dream companies.</p>
