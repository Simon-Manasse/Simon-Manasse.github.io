                <p>MathWorks develops mathematical computing software, MATLAB and Simulink. They focus on mathematical
                usage of programming, but other than that they also research machine learning, deep learning, and
                many more (AI, data science, optimization). In these fields they are looking for software engineers,
                compiler engineers, etc. </p>
                <p>Their employees stated that the work is not that strict, and everyone is friendly, smart, and 100%
                    collaborative.In essence this company is all about math and developing software for people who use
                    math with their work. Because I love both math and ICT, this is one of my dream companies.</p>
