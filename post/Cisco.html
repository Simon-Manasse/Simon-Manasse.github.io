                <p> Cisco Systems is an IT and networking brand that specializes in switches, routers, cybersecurity,
                    and IoT. They are looking for network engineers, software developers, cyber security engineers, who
                    help them make the world better.</p>
                <p>CISCO likes to provide their employees the feeling, that they are appreciated, and they are part of
                    something big. They set a big emphasis on culture as well. CISCO is one of the biggest networking
                    companies, and my experience while working with CISCO products, made me curious about networking.
