                    <h3><b>STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES</b></h3>
                    <p> I started programming at the age of 12 and I spent 4 years in school studying networking,
                        programming
                        and managing databases, and I graduated from that school.</p>

                    <h3><b>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</b></h3>
                    <p>I was obsessed with ICT ever since I was a child. I was taking apart PCs and rebuilding them
                        since I was 8.
                        I started learning programming when I was 12. I came to The Netherlands, to meet new people with
                        new ways of thinking, so I can improve my own, and to help me think outside the box.</p>

                    <h3><b>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</b></h3>
                    <p>When I finish school I'm planning on becoming a developer. I want to work at a company to gather
                        some
                        experience, and if I'll have an idea which is worthy for starting a company, I'll try to reach
                        my goal and make that idea come to life.</p>
