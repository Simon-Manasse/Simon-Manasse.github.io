                    <p>Bethesda Softworks is an American video game publisher. They work on several game projects, such
                        as
                        The Elder’s Scrolls/Fallout series. In these projects they are looking for a wide range of IT
                        professionals (AI programmer, Network administrator, System engineer). Their employees
                        confessed,
                        that the company culture is great, passionate, but can be too competitive for its own good.</p>

                    <p>Bethesda have been making fan favorites and became one of the better known game developing
                        companies.
                        Because I grew up their games, I’m biased, and my dream is to work with them.</p>
