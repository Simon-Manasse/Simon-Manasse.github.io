                <p>Bethesda Softworks is an American video game publisher. They work on several game projects, such as
                    The Elder’s Scrolls/Fallout series. In these projects they are looking for a wide range of IT
                    professionals (AI programmer, Network administrator, System engineer). Their employees confessed,
                    that the company culture is great, passionate, but can be too competitive for its own good.</p>
                <p>Bethesda have been making fan favorites and became one of the better known game developing companies.
                    Because I grew up their games, I’m biased, and my dream is to work with them.</p>
