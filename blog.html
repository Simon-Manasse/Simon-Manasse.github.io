                <h2>Study choice</h2>
                <h3><b>STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES</b></h3>
                <p> I started programming at the age of 12 and I spent 4 years in school studying networking,
                    programming
                    and managing databases, and I graduated from that school.</p>
            <h3><b>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</b></h3>
                <p>I was obsessed with ICT ever since I was a child. I was taking apart PCs and rebuilding them since I was
                    8.
                    I started learning programming when I was 12. I came to The Netherlands, to meet new people with new
                    ways of thinking, so I can improve my own, and to help me think outside the box.</p>
                <h3><b>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</b></h3>
                <p>When I finish school I'm planning on becoming a developer. I want to work at a company to gather some
                    experience, and if I'll have an idea which is worthy for starting a company, I'll try to reach my
                    goal
                    and make that idea come to life.</p>

                            <p>I am a patient person, with great logical skill. I am a fast learner and I can adapt

                            <p>Since I am a fast learner, I can learn new languages, or new tasks, which will help in
                                the
                                future. I am introverted, but I can work in groups easily, even take the role of the

                                as well.</p>

                                work
                                even

                <p>Bethesda have been making fan favorites and became one of the better known game developing companies.
                    Because I grew up their games, I’m biased, and my dream is to work with them.</p>
