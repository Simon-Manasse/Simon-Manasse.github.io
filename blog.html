            <h2>Study choice</h2>
            <p><b>STUDY CHOICE ACTIVITIES</b></p>
            <p> I started programming at the age of 12 and I spent 4 years in school studying networking, programming
                and managing databases, and I graduated from that school.</p>
            <p><b>MOTIVATE YOUR STUDY CHOICE</b></p>
            <p>as obsessed with ICT ever since I was a child. I was taking apart PCs and rebuilding them since I was 8.
                I started learning programming when I was 12. I came to The Netherlands, to meet new people with new
                ways of thinking, so I can improve my own, and to help me think outside the box.</p>
            <p><b>AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY...</b></p>
            <p>When I finish school I'm planning on becoming a developer. I want to work at a company to gather some
                experience, and if I'll have an idea which is worthy for starting a company, I'll try to reach my goal
                and make that idea come to life.</p>

                        <p>I am a patient person, with great logical skill. I am a fast learner and I can adapt easily.

                        <p>I am introverted, and I don't like to ask for help. I tend to do things on my own.</p>

                        <p><b>Opportunities</b></p>
                        <p>Since I am a fast learner, I can learn new languages, or new tasks, which will help in the
                            future. I am introverted, but I can work in groups easily, even take the role of the leader
                            as well.</p>

                        <p>I am really determined to succeed, and if I don't feel like I can do something, I will work
                            even
                            harder.</p>
